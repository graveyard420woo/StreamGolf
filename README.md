StreamGolf by graveyard420woo v1.1

This is a dynamic overlay that creates a random, procedural golf course landscape to be played by everyone in chat on your stream. 
Why not also play golf while you're streaming, right!? 
Connect your twitch and add the resulting URL as a full screen browser source. 1920 x 1080 works great.
It will render procedurally at any smaller or larger size.
2560 x 1440 (1440p) and 3840 x 2160 (4k) will generate more expansive landscapes (not just scale)
